For my Dev_1 project, I plan on creating a CRUD that will allow a user to input their favorite music. When the user inputs this, the CRUD will return a recommended album. The user will be able to select a year to get a different recommendation per decade chosen. For example, if you select 1980's and specify you want a pop album, it will recommend Let's Dance. I plan to implement various genre selections and recommendations for which decade was chosen from 1970 to 2010. If the user wants, they can edit their favorite music and get a different recommendation. Or, they can delete their favorite music entirely and start fresh. This is different from my original Dev code which was focused on money amounts. My dev_1 won't be using my code from the previous dev_0 project.
